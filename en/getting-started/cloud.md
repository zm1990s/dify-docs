Get started now with the [Sandbox plan](http://cloud.dify.ai), which includes a free trial of 200 OpenAI calls, no credit card required. To use the Sandbox plan of the cloud version, you will need a GitHub or Google account, as well as an OpenAI API key. Here's how you can get started:

1. Sign up to [Dify Cloud](https://cloud.dify.ai) and create a new Workspace or join an existing one.
2. Configure your model provider or use our hosted model provider.

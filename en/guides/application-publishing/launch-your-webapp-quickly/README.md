# Publish as a Single-page Web App

One of the benefits of creating AI applications with Dify is that you can publish a Single-page AI web app accessible to all users on the internet within minutes.

* If you're using the self-hosted open-source version, the application will run on your server
* If you're using the cloud service, the application will be hosted at [https://udify.app/](https://udify.app/).

### Publishing an AI Website

Toggle the **"In service / Disabled"** switch, your Web App URL will be effective immediately publicly shared on the internet.

We have pre-set Web App UI for the following two types of applications:

* **Text Generation (Preview)**

{% content-ref url="text-generator.md" %}
[text-generator.md](text-generator.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Conversation (Preview)**

{% content-ref url="conversation-application.md" %}
[conversation-application.md](conversation-application.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Setting Up Your AI Site

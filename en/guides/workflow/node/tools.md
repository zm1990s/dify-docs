# Tools

Within a workflow, Dify provides both built-in and customizable tools. Before utilizing these tools, you need to "authorize" them. If the built-in tools do not meet your requirements, you can create custom tools within "Dify—Tools".

Configuring a tool node generally involves two steps:

1. **Authorizing the Tool/Creating Custom Tools**
2. **Configuring Tool Inputs and Parameters**

For guidance on creating custom tools and configuring them, please refer to the [tool configuration instructions](https://docs.dify.ai/tutorials/quick-tool-integration).
